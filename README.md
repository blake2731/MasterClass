This is the project I am working on with Master Coby one Kanobi. 

A Idle game, click to get money. In early stages. More of practice in creating interfaces. 

Moving on to physics, made a ball bounce around on the screen. Added in the getting money principle when the ball hits a wall. 

Now time to work on the design, and polishing of the game.
